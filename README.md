<h1>About</h1>
This script is designed to help find the source of a proxy and perhaps be able to find the data you are purchasing else where for cheaper.
*Disclaimer this script will not be able to trace all proxies and some providers but lots of time and effor into making high quailty proxies and not just simply reselling like other providers*

<h1>URL Tracer</h1>
